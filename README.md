# Fabio Paolizzo, PhD
### AI Researcher & Systems Architect | Quantitative Finance

I architect and deploy proprietary AI systems to develop **novel, uncorrelated alpha** from alternative data. My work integrates a deep foundation in systems architecture with cutting-edge AI—including **Large Language Models** and **Knowledge Graphs**—to model complex human behavior in financial markets.

My most significant open-source contribution is the **[MUSICAL-MOODS Multimodal Dataset](https://github.com/fabiopaolizzo/musical-moods.main)**, a large-scale resource I engineered for training and validating AI models on complex, subjective human data.
